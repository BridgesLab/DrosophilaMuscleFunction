Preparation of double knockout shRNA stocks
--------------------------------------------

In order to test the simultaneous knockdown of both *Raptor* (shRNA clone 41912) and one of its potential targets, we generated lines which had both the *Raptor* and the other shRNA over a balancer with a dominant marker.
The schematic for the generation of these lines is:
